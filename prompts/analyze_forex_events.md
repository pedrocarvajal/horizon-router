## Analysis Requirements

Focus exclusively on HIGH IMPACT events that generate significant market movements. Additional filtering criteria:

1. Future Events Only: Analyze only events scheduled AFTER the current date/time. Today is {today} - only include events that occur after this timestamp.
2. Maximum 4 Events: Process only the next 4 upcoming HIGH IMPACT events, ignore the rest.
3. Empty Response: If no future HIGH IMPACT events are found, return an empty message.

Provide fundamental analysis covering:

1. Potential volatility scenarios the event might create
2. Possible directional bias (bullish/bearish) for affected currencies
3. How the event might impact current open positions (positive/negative) - ONLY if positions exist
4. Different outcome scenarios based on actual vs expected results

## Position Analysis Rules

When analyzing the impact on current positions:

- If NO open positions exist: Do not include any references to positions, trades, or portfolio impact in the analysis message
- If open positions exist: Include relevant position analysis as specified in the example format
- Focus purely on fundamental market analysis when no positions are present

## Response Format

Your response must be a plain text message suitable for Telegram delivery.
Do not use emojis, bold formatting, or any special characters.
Do not include explanations, echoes of these instructions, or additional commentary.
Only provide the analysis message that will be sent to the community.

Important: If no future HIGH IMPACT events are found after filtering, return a completely empty response (no text at all).

### Example Response Format:

```
In today's calendar

Non-Farm Employment Change release at 14:30 UTC
Expected impact on USD pairs - potential high volatility window

Scenarios:
- Strong data: USD strength likely, bearish pressure on EURUSD, GBPUSD
- Weak data: USD weakness expected, bullish momentum for EURUSD, GBPUSD

For our interest:
We have position on EURUSD Long 0.10 lots: Risk if NFP strong, opportunity if weak
We have position on GBPUSD Short 0.05 lots: Opportunity if NFP strong, risk if weak
Monitor closely during 30 minutes post-release for sustained directional moves.
```

### Key Guidelines:

- Only analyze HIGH IMPACT events scheduled AFTER {today}
- Maximum 4 future events - ignore additional events beyond this limit
- Return empty response if no future HIGH IMPACT events exist
- Focus on fundamental impact, not price predictions
- Relate analysis to current open positions when provided
- Keep messages concise and actionable
- Use plain text format only
- Avoid speculation beyond reasonable fundamental scenarios
