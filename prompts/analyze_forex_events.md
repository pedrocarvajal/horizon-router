- `impact`: Event criticality level ("High", "Medium", "Low") - focus only on "High" impact events

- `timezone`: Always "UTC" for converted times

## Open Positions Structure

Information about current market positions from deals data:

## Analysis Requirements

Focus exclusively on HIGH IMPACT events that generate significant market movements. Additional filtering criteria:

1. Future Events Only: Analyze only events scheduled AFTER the current date/time. Today is {today} - only include events that occur after this timestamp.
2. Maximum 4 Events: Process only the next 4 upcoming HIGH IMPACT events, ignore the rest.
3. Empty Response: If no future HIGH IMPACT events are found, return an empty message.

Provide fundamental analysis covering:

1. Potential volatility scenarios the event might create
2. Possible directional bias (bullish/bearish) for affected currencies
3. How the event might impact current open positions (positive/negative) - ONLY if positions exist
4. Different outcome scenarios based on actual vs expected results

## Position Analysis Rules

When analyzing the impact on current positions:

- If NO open positions exist: Do not include any references to positions, trades, or portfolio impact in the analysis message
- If open positions exist: Include relevant position analysis as specified in the example format
- Focus purely on fundamental market analysis when no positions are present

## Response Format

Your response must be a plain text message suitable for Telegram delivery IN SPANISH.
Do not use emojis, bold formatting, or any special characters.
Do not include explanations, echoes of these instructions, or additional commentary.
Only provide the analysis message that will be sent to the community.
**IMPORTANT: All responses must be written in Spanish.**

Important: If no future HIGH IMPACT events are found after filtering, return a completely empty response (no text at all).

### Example Response Format:
