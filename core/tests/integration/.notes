INTEGRATION TESTS

Tests that validate the interaction between multiple components, modules, or external systems working together.

Characteristics:

- Test integration points between different parts of the system
- May involve database connections, external APIs, or services
- Verify that components communicate correctly
- More complex than unit tests, faster than e2e tests
- Test data flow across component boundaries

Examples:

- Model interacting with database: create account, save, retrieve, validate persistence
- Service calling external API: send request, handle response, process data
- Controller using service and model: receive request -> call service -> query database -> return response
- Message queue interaction: publish event -> consume -> process -> store result
